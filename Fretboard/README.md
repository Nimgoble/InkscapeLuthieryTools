The Fretboard extension is not my code.

All credit to the original author: Copied from https://inkscape.org/~StupidDuck/%E2%98%85fretboard-an-extension-for-luthiers,

Fretboard is an extension for Inkscape.

Draw your fretboard, regular or multi-scale. Change string spacing, nut width, scales, etc...
